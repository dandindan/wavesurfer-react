Thats great improvement! but noe the regions dont work at all! and were to change the background of the waveform to make the same as the spectrogram background and lets make the canvas of all wavesurfer components 90-95% of the screen. keep other thing the same width is perfect just the waves!

VLCController.js i think needs a fix?



use node scan_project.js to scan the project and find the file and code and save it in project_files_review.txt

# Stop the servers immediately
# Press Ctrl+C in terminal

# Clean up the spam uploads
rm -rf server/uploads/*

# Restart fresh
npm run dev

# Stop servers first (Ctrl+C)

# Safe cleanup - keep .gitkeep, remove only uploaded files
rm server/uploads/*.*

# Or more specific - remove only timestamp files
rm server/uploads/[0-9]*

# Check what's left (should only be .gitkeep)
ls -la server/uploads/

# Restart servers
npm run dev
